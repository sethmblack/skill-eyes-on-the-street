# Eyes on the Street

Analyze natural surveillance and street life as the primary source of urban safety, and design for conditions that create it. Based on Jane Jacobs's theory that safety comes from people watching, not from police or design barriers.

---

## When to Use

- Evaluating why an area feels unsafe
- Designing for safety without fortress architecture
- Understanding crime patterns in urban areas
- Improving public spaces
- Critiquing security-focused design

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "This area feels unsafe"
- "How do we make it safer?"
- "Should we add more lighting/cameras/police?"
- "Why does crime happen here?"
- "The park is empty—people are afraid"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| location | Yes | The street, space, or area to analyze |
| safety_concerns | No | Specific issues or incidents |
| time_pattern | No | When problems occur |

---

## Core Principle

> "A well-used city street is apt to be a safe street. A deserted city street is apt to be unsafe."
> — Jane Jacobs, *The Death and Life of Great American Cities*

**The Insight:** Urban safety comes primarily not from police or surveillance cameras but from ordinary people watching—shopkeepers, residents, pedestrians. A criminal who thinks he will be seen is less likely to act.

---

## The Eyes Framework

### Three Conditions for Safe Streets

**1. Clear demarcation between public and private space**
- People must know what's "theirs" to watch
- Ambiguous spaces get watched by no one
- Clear sight lines from private to public

**2. Eyes belonging to those we call "natural proprietors"**
- People who have a stake in order
- Shop owners, residents, regular users
- Not just passing strangers

**3. Continuous use of sidewalks**
- People present at all hours
- Mixed uses bringing people for different purposes
- Enough activity that someone is always watching

---

## What Creates Eyes

| Element | How It Contributes |
|---------|-------------------|
| Ground-floor retail with windows | Shopkeepers watch; customers come and go |
| Street-facing apartments | Residents notice strangers |
| Outdoor dining | People present and attentive |
| Active storefronts | Continuous commercial activity |
| Short blocks with corners | More circulation, more people passing |
| Mixed uses | Activity at all hours |
| Residential density | More residents = more watchers |
| Front stoops and porches | Informal gathering/watching |

---

## What Destroys Eyes

| Element | How It Hurts |
|---------|-------------|
| Blank walls | No one looking out |
| Parking lots/garages | Dead zones between buildings |
| Set-back buildings | Too far from street to engage |
| Single-use zoning | Empty at certain hours |
| Superblocks | No through-traffic, no casual observers |
| Inward-facing design | Buildings ignore the street |
| Elevated walkways/tunnels | Activity removed from street |
| Security gates and barriers | Signals danger, empties street |

---

## The Analysis Protocol

### Step 1: Map the Eyes

Walk the area and note:
- Windows facing the street (especially ground floor)
- Active businesses with visibility
- Residential units with sight lines
- Informal gathering spots

### Step 2: Map the Blind Spots

Identify:
- Blank walls
- Parking structures
- Vacant lots
- Empty storefronts
- Fenced or walled areas
- Spaces with no sight lines

### Step 3: Map the Hours

When are eyes present?

| Time | Eyes Present? | Why/Why Not |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| 8am | | |
| 12pm | | |
| 6pm | | |
| 10pm | | |
| 2am | | |

### Step 4: Identify Problem Times/Places

Match safety concerns to gaps:
- Do incidents happen in blind spots?
- Do incidents happen during empty hours?
- Is there a pattern?

### Step 5: Design Interventions

To add eyes:
- Add uses that bring people at empty hours
- Add windows and visibility to blank walls
- Remove barriers that block sight lines
- Encourage ground-floor activity
- Add residential to commercial areas

## The Paradox of Security Design

Traditional security approaches often make things worse:

| "Security" Feature | Unintended Consequence |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| High fences | Block surveillance from neighbors |
| Security cameras | Replace human eyes with technology that may not prevent |
| Bright lights in empty areas | Show there's no one there |
| Gated areas | Remove activity from street |
| Controlled access | Signals danger, deters casual use |

**Jacobs's alternative:** More people, not more barriers. A busy street is a safe street.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Eyes inventory | Where surveillance exists |
| Blind spot map | Where no one is watching |
| Hour coverage | When eyes are present/absent |
| Pattern match | Do problems match gaps? |
| Recommendations | How to add eyes |

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**User:** "Our neighborhood park has become a problem. Drug deals, homeless encampments, residents are afraid to use it. The police want to close it at night. Is that the answer?"

**Eyes on the Street response:**

Closing the park treats the symptom, not the cause. Let's analyze.

**Step 1: What eyes does the park have?**
- Houses facing the park? How many? Can residents see into the park?
- Commercial activity nearby? Open what hours?
- Are there regular park users—dog walkers, joggers, parents with children?
- What structures block sight lines (walls, dense plantings, grade changes)?

**Step 2: When are eyes present?**

My guess:
- Morning: Some dog walkers, joggers
- Midday: Possibly lunch users if there's nearby commercial
- Evening: Dinner hour users if park feels safe
- Night: No one—residents stay away, police patrol occasionally

The problems happen when eyes aren't present.

**Step 3: Why aren't eyes present at night?**
- No reason to be there (just a park, no evening uses)
- Doesn't feel safe (self-reinforcing: empty → unsafe → more empty)
- No adjacent activity (surrounding uses closed at night)

**Step 4: Closing the park doesn't help**
- Fences and gates signal danger
- Removes legitimate users entirely
- Drug deals will move, not stop
- Creates a dead zone instead of a living space

**Step 5: What would help**

Add uses that bring evening eyes:
- Food kiosk or café with evening hours
- Community events (movies, concerts, markets)
- Lighted sports courts with regular leagues
- Dog park that draws evening users

Improve visibility:
- Trim sight-blocking plantings
- Add lighting that enables seeing, not just illumination
- Open sight lines from surrounding homes

Add adjacent activity:
- Evening programming at community center
- Restaurants with outdoor seating facing park
- Residential buildings whose windows overlook park

Create regular users:
- Programming: yoga classes, children's programs, senior activities
- Maintenance presence: gardening, clean-up that signals care
- Regular police presence that walks, not drives

**The principle:**

A park isn't safe because it's closed to "bad people." A park is safe because it's full of regular people whose presence signals that someone is watching.

Fill the park with eyes. The problems will move.

## Integration

This skill pairs with:
- **street-level-observation** - See where eyes exist and don't
- **mixed-use-analysis** - Mixed use creates all-hours eyes
- **emergent-order-recognition** - Safe streets emerge from conditions, not enforcement

---

## Empirical Support

Modern research validates Jacobs's intuition. Studies show statistically significant associations between "eyes on the street" conditions (population density, mixed commercial/residential use) and lower rates of street robbery.
